# Task Priorities and Implementation Plan

## Task 1: Revise apply_stdp Function
- Priority: High (addressing existing issues in previously delivered code)
- Focus areas:
  1. Remove hardcoded test logic
  2. Improve computational efficiency through vectorization
  3. Maintain core functionality and correctness

## Task 2: Create numerical_integrate Function
- Priority: Medium (new functionality)
- Focus areas:
  1. Implement using scipy.integrate.quad
  2. Ensure proper error handling
  3. Create comprehensive documentation
  4. Provide usage examples

## Implementation Order
1. First complete the apply_stdp revision
2. Then implement the numerical_integrate function

## Rationale
- Fixing issues in existing code takes precedence over adding new functionality
- The apply_stdp revision requires careful attention to ensure we don't break existing functionality
- Both tasks are well-defined and can be completed sequentially
