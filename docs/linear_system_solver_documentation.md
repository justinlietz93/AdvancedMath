# Linear System Solver Documentation

## Overview

The `linear_system_solver` function provides a robust solution for solving systems of linear equations in the form Ax = b, where:
- A is a square coefficient matrix
- x is the unknown vector to be determined
- b is the right-hand side vector

This documentation provides detailed information about the function, its mathematical background, usage scenarios, and limitations.

## Mathematical Background

A system of linear equations can be represented in matrix form as Ax = b, where:

- A is an n×n matrix of coefficients
- x is an n×1 vector of unknowns
- b is an n×1 vector of constants

For example, the system:
```
3x + 2y = 7
x + y = 3
```

Can be written in matrix form as:
```
[3 2] [x] = [7]
[1 1] [y]   [3]
```

The solution to this system is the vector x that satisfies the equation Ax = b. For a system to have a unique solution, the coefficient matrix A must be non-singular (invertible), which means its determinant is non-zero.

## Solution Method

The `linear_system_solver` function uses NumPy's `linalg.solve` function, which implements an efficient algorithm based on LU decomposition to solve the system. This approach is generally more numerically stable and efficient than explicitly computing the inverse of A.

The LU decomposition factors the matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The system is then solved in two steps:
1. Solve Ly = b for y using forward substitution
2. Solve Ux = y for x using backward substitution

## Function Signature and Parameters

```python
def linear_system_solver(matrix_A, vector_b):
    """
    Solves a system of linear equations in the form Ax = b.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix_A : array_like
        Coefficient matrix of the linear system. Must be square and non-singular.
        
    vector_b : array_like
        Right-hand side vector of the linear system.
        
    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Solution vector x that satisfies Ax = b.
    """
```

## Error Handling

The function includes comprehensive error handling for various edge cases:

1. **Input Type Validation**:
   - Checks if inputs are None
   - Ensures inputs can be converted to numeric arrays
   - Verifies matrix_A is 2D and vector_b is 1D

2. **Data Quality Checks**:
   - Detects NaN or infinity values
   - Prevents empty arrays

3. **Shape Compatibility**:
   - Ensures matrix_A is square
   - Verifies matrix_A and vector_b have compatible dimensions

4. **Numerical Stability**:
   - Handles singular matrices with informative error messages
   - Catches and explains other numerical computation failures

## Limitations

1. **Numerical Precision**:
   - Results are subject to floating-point precision limitations
   - Very ill-conditioned matrices may lead to inaccurate results

2. **Performance**:
   - For very large systems (n > 10,000), memory and computation time may become significant
   - Not optimized for sparse matrices (consider scipy.sparse for such cases)

3. **Special Cases**:
   - Does not handle underdetermined or overdetermined systems
   - No special handling for symmetric or positive-definite matrices

## Performance Considerations

- Time complexity: O(n³) for an n×n system
- Space complexity: O(n²) for storing the coefficient matrix

For large systems, consider using specialized solvers from SciPy that can exploit sparsity or other matrix properties.
